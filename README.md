# NumPy:
    NumPy in Python is a library that is used to work with arrays and was created in 2005. 
    
    NumPy is an open-source library that can be used freely.
    
    NumPy library in Python has functions for working in domain of Linear algebra, Matrices, Fourier transfrom.
    
    NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
    
    NumPy Supports basic operations such as average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, variance, and many more.

The key concept in NumPy is the NumPy array datatype. A NumPy array may have one or more dimensions:
    
    * One dimention array (1D) represent vectors.
    
    * Two-dimension array (2D) represent matrices.
    
    * and higher diemensional arrays represent tensors.

NumPy is an important library for:

    * Data Science

    * Machine Learning
    
    * Signal and image processing
    
    * Scientific and engineer computing
